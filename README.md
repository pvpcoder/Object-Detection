# Object Detection with SSD MobileNet V2
This project uses TensorFlow Hub's pre-trained **SSD MobileNet V2** model to perform object detection on an input image, drawing bounding boxes and class labels for recognized objects.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using a pre-trained deep learning model
- Visualizes detected objects with bounding boxes and confidence scores
- Easy-to-use code structure for beginners and developers

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow  
- TensorFlow Hub  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-hub opencv-python numpy
